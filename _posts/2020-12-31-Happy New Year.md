2020 has been a year to rember. While many of you saw hughe changes in your working life I have been on parental leave for the lions share of this year. Of course nothing ended up as planed. All activites that I planned that me and my son should do during this year ended up in something different. But still, I'm very happy with this year and I'm looking forward for what will be coming in 2021. I will be ready for 2021 with fresh antibodies and new ideas to explore at work. 

Happy New Year
